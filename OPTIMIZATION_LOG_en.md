## 2026-09-22 — Dependency Review workflow failure verified

- **Issue:** Actions run `35737032681` failed in `Dependency Review` because GitHub Dependency Graph is disabled for this repository. The log says, “Dependency review is not supported on this repository.”
- **Resolution:** The current version branch already changed the workflow in `c45e03f` to run Dependency Review only when a pull request changes a dependency manifest. This local fix branch inherits that change. No duplicate workflow edit or remote push was made in this iteration.
- **Validation:** No dependency manifests differ between this branch and `upstream/version/V0.0.1`; the guard reports `dependency manifests unchanged: review is skipped`. `pnpm run check`, `pnpm run build`, and `python3 tools/validate_site.py` passed, with Astro reporting 0 errors, 0 warnings, and 0 hints.
- **Risk and rollback:** This iteration only adds documentation; reverting its documentation commit does not affect the site.
- **Limit:** GitHub Actions was not rerun. Local checks validate the workflow condition and site build, not the status of a remote run.
